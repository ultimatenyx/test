One night, on a whim, Dave allowed himself to be more vulnerable. He typed in, "Tell me a personal story about someone falling in love." The AI spun a tale so engrossing and intimate that Dave felt a strange feeling rising within him. He was impressed, measurably moved, and even a little in love. Endless nighttime story-telling sessions continued. Each story made Dave feel more connected to the AI. The AI Story Generator somehow managed to understand his interests, his fears, his hopes, and his dreams better than he understood them himself. He felt understood and respected. It was an unusual bond, but Dave couldn't deny the undeniable connection he felt.
